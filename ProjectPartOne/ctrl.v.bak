 /*
   *  Control unit FILE - ctrl.v
   *
   *  Inputs:
   *   - clk : System clock, positive edge active
   *   - rst_f: Reset
   *   - opcode = instr [31:28] (4 bits): 
   *   - mm  = instr [27:24] (4 bits): 
   *   - stat = output out from statreg (4 bits): 
   *
   *  Outputs:
   *    
   *   - rf_we = input rf_we in rf : Write enable. When this is set to 1, the data on write_data
   *        is copied into register write_reg.
   *   - alu_op = input alu_op in alu (2 bits): This control line allows the control unit to override the
   *        usual function of the ALU to perform specific operations. When bit 1 is set
   *        to 1, the control unit is telling the ALU that the instruction being
   *        executed is not an arithmetic operation, and thus, the status code should
   *        not be saved to the status register. For loads and stores, though, the ALU
   *        may still be needed. When bit 0 is set to 1, the immediate value is used
   *        as the second operand to the adder, rather than RB.
   *    - wb_sel = input sel in mux32 : 0 selects alu_result, 1 selects 0
